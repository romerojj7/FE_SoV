In this game, you will control a small army of characters, or units, in combat against an opposing army. The objective of each chapter is to destroy all of the opposing army's units. Both sides will alternate turns, with the player's turn being first.

Each unit can move a certain number of tiles. To move a unit:
1. Place the cursor over them. 
1. Press a to select them.
1. Guide the unit to the desired location.

Once a unit can move in close enough to attack an enemy, do the following in order to attack: 
1. Select the attack option. 
1. A battle forecast will pop up, telling you the damage your unit will do to an enemy versus the damage the enemy will do to your unit. 
1. If the forecast is in your favor, press a to confirm and attack the enemy unit.

There are also a few other options available when a unit is selected. A unit can trade items with adjacent units, certain units can heal, and a unit can wait to end its turn where it is. The current army's turn continues until all the units in the army have taken their turns, at which point the next army takes it's turn.

**Q**: Can I stop playing mid-chapter and resume playing later?

**A**: Yes. In order to do so:
1. place your cursor on a tile unoccupied by a unit. 
1. A menu will come up. The bookmark option in this menu will create a bookmark of the games current state. 
1. The next time you load the game, you will get the option to load a bookmark instead of continuing from a savepoint. 
	*Note: Loading the bookmark will delete it, so you will have to make another bookmark every time you want to stop mid-chapter.*

**Q**: Shouldn't I play the other games in the series first?

**A**: There is no need. Fire Emblem is a series tied together by its mechanics, not an overarching story. Most Fire Emblem games are self contained stories. A beginner will be able to enjoy FE: Sov as much as a series veteran.
